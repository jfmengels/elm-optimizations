[[Elm optimization techniques]]

âœ… Implemented through a minifier. See [[#Minifiers]].

When compiling a tail-call recursive function, Elm uses the `continue` keyword to force going back the beginning of the loop.

```elm
goToEnd : List a -> List b
goToEnd list =
    case list of
        [] ->
            []

        _ :: xs ->
            fn xs
```

```js
var $author$project$A$goToEnd = function (list) {
 goToEnd:
 while (true) {
  if (!list.b) {
   return _List_Nil;
  } else {
   var xs = list.b;
   var $temp$list = xs;
   list = $temp$list;
   continue goToEnd;
  }
 }
};
```

The `continue` keyword can be useful if you have code like this

```js
if (condition) {
  // Do something
  continue label;
}
// Code that should be skipped if condition is true
```

but in Elm's case, since all* branches are exclusive (through the use of `else` code blocks), the `continue` keyword serves no purpose.

\***Exception:** If the recursion happens inside a JavaScript `switch` (for some pattern matching), then the `continue` is used to avoid executing the code of the next branch.

From benchmarking the function (in June 2025 with Chrome and Firefox, not Safari) above with and without the `continue` instruction, the results seem to be the same.

I therefore think this instruction should be removed as well as the label it refers to, in order to reduce the bundle size. The gain will be almost non-existent after minification and gzip, but if there's no reason to keep it, we should not have it.

## Minifiers

It seems that minifiers (`uglifyjs` at least) removes the `continue` keyword when possible, as well as the label that the `continue` keyword was pointing to.

I therefore consider this feature to be completed when using a minifier.
